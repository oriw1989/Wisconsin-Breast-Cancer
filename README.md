# Wisconsin-Breast-Cancer
This project trains and tests a predictive model for biopsies of potential breast cancer patients, using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset.

After some data cleaning and exploration, we decide on using a tree based method.

A good predictor is achieved by using a Random Forest classifier. The results on a final validation set are:

Sensitivity: 35/35 = 100% (this is only a statistical 100%, of course)

Specificity: 48/49 = 98%
